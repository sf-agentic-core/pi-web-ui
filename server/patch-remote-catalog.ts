/**
 * Remote-catalog merge patch for @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent.
 *
 * The SDK composes each built-in provider's model list as
 *     mergeModels(builtinStaticCatalog, pi.devRemoteCatalog)
 * which is a UNION: same-id entries get replaced by the newer pi.dev row, new
 * ids are appended, but stale built-in models are kept forever (and the UI
 * reports "新增 N 个模型" when the overlay grows).
 *
 * pi-web-ui wants the picker to mirror the OFFICIAL remote catalog exactly —
 * an "ensure latest, no merge, no 'new N' noise" behavior. This module rewrites
 * the installed copy of remote-catalog-provider.js so the remote overlay
 * REPLACES the built-in catalog entirely whenever pi.dev data is present:
 *     getModels: () => (dynamicModels.length > 0 ? dynamicModels : provider.getModels())
 * (the built-in catalog only serves as fallback while no remote data has been
 * received yet, so the list can never be empty).
 *
 * Same pattern as patch-node-pty.ts: idempotent (checks before rewriting),
 * best-effort (a read-only node_modules or an SDK version whose source no
 * longer matches the search strings just skips the patch and keeps the SDK's
 * default union semantics — never a crash). MUST be imported before the SDK
 * modules are first loaded (agent-service.ts imports this first).
